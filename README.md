We built Distributed Learning Cluster, that can fairly schedule jobs of different preloaded models. This is project is done from scratch and includes the foundational modules like
 
- **Distributed Log Grepper** - This module is used to debug the entire application.
- **Distributed Failure Detector** - This module is used to find the failed processes.
- **Distributed File System** - This module is used to handle the input and output files of the ML Jobs keeping the consistency and availability in mind.
- **Distributed Learning Cluster** - This module is responsible of allocating the fair amount of resources to each task.
